The modulus the count really needs, once the squarefree condition is
expanded.

WHAT IS AT STAKE

Remark {#rem:layertail} measured the truncation in m at
M* ~ N^{0.1089}, well inside the Bombieri-Vinogradov range, and then
found the barrier relocated rather than removed: the layers carry a
squarefree condition on the cofactor k = (N-p)/m, and detecting it
costs mu^2(k) = sum_{d^2 | k} mu(d).  Expanding it,

    L(N;m) = sum_{d, (d,m)=1} mu(d) L2(N;m,d),
    L2(N;m,d) := sum_{j<N/(md^2), (j,m)=1} (log(d^2 j)) Lambda(N - m d^2 j),

and L2 is a prime count in the progression p = N (mod m d^2) with no
squarefree condition left in it -- a clean Bombieri-Vinogradov object
of modulus q = m d^2.  So the whole count is

    sum over pairs (m,d) with q = m d^2 < N, of mu(m) mu(d) L2(N;m,d),

and the question that decides the route is how large q has to be
allowed to grow.  M* said the m alone is cheap.  If the COMBINED
modulus were also cheap -- log Q*/log N below 1/2 -- the demand would
sit inside Bombieri-Vinogradov and the relocation of Remark
{#rem:layertail} would be illusory.  That is what is measured here,
and the measurement is decisive either way.

paper/theorem_A.md.

PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS (written before this script was run)

  Y1  The expansion is exact: summing mu(m)mu(d)L2 over every pair
      with m d^2 < N reproduces sum_{p<N} Lambda(N-p) log p to better
      than 1e-12 relative.
  Y2  The deficit |total - T(N;Q)|/N, where T sums only the pairs with
      m d^2 < Q, decreases over Q = 1e2, 1e3, 1e4, 1e5, 1e6.
  Y3  The barrier really does come back: with Q*(N) the least Q past
      which the deficit stays under 0.01, log Q*/log N is at least 0.5
      at every N. A REFUTATION here is the interesting outcome -- it
      would say the combined modulus stays inside the
      Bombieri-Vinogradov range and Remark [rem:layertail]'s
      relocation is not where the difficulty is.
  Y4  The convergence uses mu on d, not just size: holding every
      L2 fixed and drawing the sign of mu(d) at random for d >= 2,
      the deficit at Q = 1e4 is larger than mu's at every N, for every
      one of 16 draws.

REFUTATION RULE (fixed before the run)

  Y1  REFUTED at 1e-12 relative at any N. It is an exact expansion, so
      a failure is an error in the derivation.
  Y2  REFUTED by a single rise.
  Y3  REFUTED if log Q*/log N is under 0.5 at any N.
  Y4  REFUTED if any draw does at least as well as mu at any N.

  All four gate.

  THE CONTROL is Y4's sign draw on d, with every L2(N;m,d) held fixed
  and the sign pattern on d alone varied. Like the control of Remark
  {#rem:layerdecay} and unlike the coin of Remark {#rem:whycoinwins},
  it cannot buy square-root cancellation inside a term.
