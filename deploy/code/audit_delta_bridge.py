r"""The gap between the two cuts is the object called Delta.

Supports {#rem:cutbridge}.

WHAT IS AT STAKE

The companion run code/audit_cut_bridge.py asks whether the fixed-cut
statement reaches the moving-cut object by telescoping over the outer
index, and finds that it does so only at a cost that no unconditional
argument supplies.  That was the wrong bridge.  There is a direct one.

Write J = sum_{k<K, (k,N)=1} mu(k) Emu(N-1; k) for the fixed-cut object
at the extreme endpoint, and T1* = sum_k mu(k) Emu(Y_k; k) for the
moving-cut object, Y_k = ceil(N - alpha k) - 1.  Their difference is
carried by the n it drops:

    n > Y_k  <=>  n >= N - alpha k  <=>  N - n <= alpha k  <=>  m <= alpha,

m = (N-n)/k.  So on exactly those terms mu(k) mu(N-n) = mu(k) mu(mk) =
mu(m) mu^2(k): the Moebius factor lands on the SHORT variable and the
long variable carries only mu^2 >= 0.  That is the shape of the term
this note calls Delta, with weight 1 in place of log m.  Hence

    T1* = J - Xi,      Xi = Xi_main - Xi_mean,
    Xi_main = sum_{m<=alpha} mu(m) sum_{k<K, (k,mN)=1} mu^2(k) Lambda(N-mk),
    Xi_mean = sum_{k<K, (k,N)=1} mu(k)/phi(k) * ( C(N-1) - C(Y_k) ),

with C(t) = sum_{n<=t} Lambda(n) mu(N-n).  If this is an identity, then
the fixed-cut theorem is not superseded by the corrected formulation:
it is one of the two ingredients, and the term whose omission was the
defect in the published equation is the other.  The two cuts are a
Delta apart.

WHAT IS MEASURED

For N even and alpha = N^theta, with K = (N-1)/alpha:

  Z1  the bridge is exact: T1* against J - Xi_main + Xi_mean, where
      T1* is built from the cofactor cut (sum over k | N-n with
      (N-n)/k > alpha) and J from the full divisor count at truncation
      K, so the two sides share no accumulation.

  Z2  Xi is what it is claimed to be: the k-side difference
      sum_k mu(k) [ Emu(N-1;k) - Emu(Y_k;k) ], accumulated over residue
      classes, against Xi_main - Xi_mean, accumulated over m.

  Z3  the bridge term sits on the short variable: the largest m
      carrying a surviving term in Xi_main, against alpha.

  Z4  sizes, reported not judged: |J|/N, |Xi|/N, |T1*|/N.

FALSIFICATION, registered before the run

  Z1  REFUTED if the two sides disagree by more than 1e-12 relative to
      N.  Then the difference of the two cuts is not Delta's shape and
      the claim above is wrong.
  Z2  REFUTED at the same tolerance.  Then the split of Xi into a main
      term and a mean term is misstated.
  Z3  REFUTED if any surviving m exceeds alpha.  Then the bridge term
      is not on the short variable, it is not Delta's shape, and it
      closes by no argument given here.
  Z4  is reported, not judged.  Sizes at accessible N say nothing about
      an asymptotic bound.

  PREDICTION.  Z1-Z3 hold.  Z4 shows |Xi|/N of the same order as |J|/N
  and |T1*|/N -- the bridge is not a small correction to be waved
  through, which is the reason it needs Delta's estimate rather than a
  triangle inequality.

NULL.  None applies: deterministic finite sums, no sampling, no sign
input.  The control is that each identity is accumulated on two sides
that share no index order -- divisor counts against residue classes in
Z2, cofactor cut against full truncation in Z1.
