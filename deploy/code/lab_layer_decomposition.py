The same count cut the other way: a Mobius-signed sum of nonnegative
layers.

WHAT IS AT STAKE

Proposition {#prop:untrunc} cut sum_k (log k) H(N;k) by k and found the
count assembled as a difference of two large one-signed masses, with
the reduction's truncation falling in the middle of the cancellation.
[eq:dilate] supplies the other variable.  Writing
H(N;k) = sum_{m<N/k,(m,k)=1} Lambda(N-mk) mu(m) and exchanging,

    sum_{k} (log k) H(N;k) = sum_{m} mu(m) L(N;m),
    L(N;m) := sum_{k<N/m, (k,m)=1, mu(k)!=0} (log k) Lambda(N-mk),

and every L(N;m) is NONNEGATIVE.  So the Goldbach count is an
alternating sum, signed by mu, of nonnegative layers -- and since
L(N;m) is of size about N/m, the cancellation that produces S(N)N out
of layers of total size N log N is a Mertens cancellation in m.

That is the opposite situation from the k side.  Remark
{#rem:whycoinwins} showed a coin BEATS mu when the signs sit on k,
because there mu's progression sum is the dilated wall while a coin's
is a sum of independent signs.  Here the magnitudes are fixed and
nonnegative and only the sign pattern varies, so sum mu(m)/m -> 0
should make mu much better than a coin.  If it does not, the m side
has no Mertens gain and the decomposition is worthless; that is what
Z4 tests.

PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS (written before this script was run)

  Z1  The exchange is exact: sum_m mu(m) L(N;m) reproduces
      sum_{p<N} Lambda(N-p) log p to better than 1e-12 relative.
  Z2  The first layer is a definite multiple of the answer:
      L(N;1)/(S(N)N) lies in [1, 10] at every N.
  Z3  The convergence in m is slow: the partial sum
      |sum_{m<M} mu(m) L(N;m)| at M = N^{0.25} still exceeds twice
      |total| at every N.
  Z4  mu beats a coin here. Holding every L(N;m) fixed and drawing
      eps(m) = +-1 on the squarefree m >= 2 (eps(1) = 1),
      |sum mu(m)L| is below the minimum over 16 draws of
      |sum eps(m)L| at every N.

REFUTATION RULE (fixed before the run)

  Z1  REFUTED at 1e-12 relative at any N. It is an exchange of two
      finite sums, so a failure is an error in the derivation.
  Z2  REFUTED if the ratio leaves [1, 10] at any N.
  Z3  REFUTED if the partial sum is at or under twice the total
      anywhere -- which would mean the layers converge quickly and the
      truncation in m is cheap.
  Z4  REFUTED if mu is at or above the minimum draw at any N, in which
      case the Mertens cancellation is not what is doing the work and
      this decomposition explains nothing.

  All four gate.

  THE CONTROL is Z4's sign draw, and it is the right one here for the
  reason Remark {#rem:whycoinwins} is not: the layers L(N;m) are held
  fixed, so the coin cannot buy square-root cancellation inside them.
  Only the sign pattern across m varies, which is exactly the thing
  being credited.
