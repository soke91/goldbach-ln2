"Numerical confirmation of the load-bearing quantity".

WHAT IS UNDER TEST

Lemma [lem:extract] factorises the extraction coefficient

    B_w = sum_{k<K,(k,N)=1} mu(k) w_k / phi(k)
        = sum_{d<K,(d,N)=1} b_d (mu(d)/phi(d)) rho_{dN}(K/d),

    rho_n(x) = sum_{j<x, (j,n)=1} mu(j)/phi(j).

For the single-divisor weight w_k = [d0 | k], i.e. b = delta_{d0}, this
collapses to |B_w| phi(d0) = |rho_{d0 N}(K/d0)|, and the paper prints

    K/d0            1        7       13      143      974    30199
    |B_w| phi(d0)   1.000000 0.750000 0.066667 0.003384 0.004166 0.000529

at N = 99,999,998, theta' = 0.56, K = 30199.  The value of d0 behind
each column is not printed -- only the ratio.  But rho_{d0 N} carries
the condition (j, d0 N) = 1, so it depends on the prime factors of d0
and not only on K/d0.  Whether the table is reproducible from the
parameters the paper states is therefore itself under test.

PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS (written before this script was run)

  T1  K = floor(N^0.56) = 30199, and 30199 = 13 * 23 * 101 is squarefree.
  T2  Lemma [lem:extract] is exact: for every squarefree d0 < K coprime
      to N, brute-force B_w over k < K equals mu(d0)/phi(d0) *
      rho_{d0N}(K/d0) with the SAME strict inequality j < K/d0, to
      machine precision.  This is the lemma itself, since b = delta_{d0}
      spans the space by linearity.
  T3  |B_w| phi(d0) is NOT a function of floor(K/d0): at a fixed value of
      that ratio it takes several distinct values, determined by which
      small primes divide d0.  Specifically at floor(K/d0) = 7 it takes
      the four values 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 according to gcd(d0, 15).
  T4  The published column at K/d0 = 7 reads 0.750000, which under T3
      pins d0 to 3 | d0, 5 not| d0 -- one class among four.  So the
      published row is not reproducible from the printed parameters.
  T5  The published column at K/d0 = 13 reads 0.066667 = 1/15.  Under
      the strict convention j < K/d0 no admissible d0 produces it; under
      j <= K/d0 some d0 does.  I.e. the table was computed with a
      convention different from the one Lemma [lem:extract] states.
  T6  The qualitative claim survives all of this: |B_w| phi(d0) is of
      order 1 only when K/d0 = O(1), and is bounded by a small multiple
      of e^{-c sqrt(log(K/d0))} across the range.

REFUTATION RULE (fixed before the run)

  T1 REFUTED if K != 30199 or 30199 is not squarefree.
  T2 REFUTED by a single d0 with |brute - factorised| > 1e-12.
  T3 REFUTED if the ratio determines the value, i.e. if every ratio
     class in the scan yields exactly one distinct value.
  T4 REFUTED if 0.750000 is the only value attained at ratio 7.
  T5 REFUTED if some admissible d0 gives 0.066667 under j < K/d0.
  T6 REFUTED if max |B_w| phi(d0) over d0 <= N^{theta'-1/2} = 3 exceeds
     0.5, or if some d0 with K/d0 > 1000 gives |B_w| phi(d0) > 0.05.

  T2 and T6 gate: the script exits non-zero if either fails, because
  they are the lemma and the theorem.  T3-T5 are reported as findings
  about the table's reproducibility and do not gate -- an unreproducible
  table is a defect in the paper, not a refutation of the lemma.
