OPEN.md, second half of "목표보다 강한 것을 공격하고 있는가" -- how much
saving Proposition {#prop:onesided} actually asks for.

WHAT THIS MEASURES AND WHY

Proposition [prop:onesided] says binary Goldbach follows from the
one-sided bound E_3 > -S(N)(1-A(N))N(1+o(1)).  That is weaker than the
consumed |E_3| <<_A N(log N)^{-A}, but "weaker" is not a currency.  The
currency in this subject is the saving over the unconditional bound, so
this script measures that.

The unconditional bound is the triangle inequality on the k-sum,

    B(N) := sum_{k<K, (k,N)=1} (log k) |E_mu(N;k)|,

which is what Huang-Li take before appealing to EH_mu.  Brun-Titchmarsh
gives |E_mu(N;k)| << N/phi(k) and sum_{k<K} 1/phi(k) << log K, so
B(N) << N (log N)^2 -- and that is the only unconditional input.  Then:

  * the consumed bound needs B(N) beaten by a factor (log N)^{A+2} for
    every A, i.e. by every power of log;
  * [eq:onesided] needs B(N) beaten only by
    B(N) / (S(N)(1-A(N))N), which is ~ (log N)^2 / (S(1-A)) -- a FIXED
    power, about 2 for almost all N and about 3 at primorials.

That is the concrete sense in which the direct route is easier, and it
is what this script pins down.  It also checks the awkward part: the
proposition is asymptotic, so at accessible N the condition may fail.

PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS (written before this script was run)

  G1  B(N)/(N (log N)^2) lies in [0.02, 0.5] at every N tested and
      varies by less than a factor 2 across the range, i.e. B ~ N(log N)^2
      and Brun-Titchmarsh is the right scale.
  G2  |E_3(N)| / B(N) < 0.05 at every N: keeping the signs mu(k) buys at
      least a factor 20 over the triangle bound Huang-Li discard.
  G3  Fitting the required saving B(N)/(S(N)(1-A(N))N) as (log N)^b
      gives b in [1.8, 2.6] -- a fixed power near 2.
  G4  E_3(N) > -S(N)(1-A(N))N holds at every N tested with N >= 10^6,
      and fails for at least one N <= 4*10^5.  The proposition is
      asymptotic and the accessible range straddles its crossover.

REFUTATION RULE (fixed before the run)

  G1  REFUTED if any value leaves [0.02, 0.5], or if max/min > 2.
  G2  REFUTED if any ratio is at least 0.05.
  G3  REFUTED if b leaves [1.8, 2.6].
  G4  REFUTED if the condition fails at any N >= 10^6, or if it holds at
      every N <= 4*10^5.

  All four gate.  G4 is deliberately two-sided: a route that could not
  be seen to fail anywhere accessible would be untested, and one that
  failed at the top would be refuted outright.

BACKS: Proposition {#prop:nolog} in paper/theorem_A.md -- that the
demand is a constant-factor bound on B(N) and asks no saving in
log N -- and Remark {#rem:relocate}.
