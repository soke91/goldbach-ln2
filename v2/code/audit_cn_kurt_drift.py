Does the one statistic that survived the coin survive growing N?

WHAT IS AT STAKE

rem:cnlaw found the first thing in this branch to survive lem:coin:
over even N in (2e6, 4e6] the excess kurtosis of
G(N) = C(N)/sqrt(V(N)) is +0.26422, while sixty-four independent sign
patterns on mu's support give -0.01825 +- 0.03957 and never exceed
+0.042.  G is not Gaussian and its non-Gaussianity is not something a
coin makes.

That was one band, and OPEN.md's item 1 says so in the same breath:
**a law needs the drift in N and one band has none.**  This is that
measurement.  It decides between two readings that the single band
cannot separate:

  a finite-N effect -- the excess kurtosis falls as the number of
  terms grows, on its way to the Gaussian the draft's law assumed; or

  a law -- it does not fall, and G is non-Gaussian at every scale
  reached, which is a property of C(N) and not of the range.

THE DESIGN

Seven octaves, (2^b, 2^(b+1)] for b = 17..23, so the top band is
N up to 1.68e7 and the whole ladder is covered by ONE pair of FFTs:
C is the convolution of Lambda with mu and V that of mu^2 with
Lambda^2, both computed once to the top and then sliced per band.
The coin arm is the same convolution with mu replaced by
eps * mu^2, eps uniform in {-1,+1}; its rfft of Lambda is cached, so a
draw costs one transform pair.  Thirty-two draws per ladder give the
error bar that blocking inside a band cannot -- rem:cnlaw's Q2
measured that blocking to be too small by a factor of 55.

BACKS: Remark {#rem:cnkurt} in paper/wall_v3.md.

PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS (written before this script was run)

  D1  THE GATE.  Re-measured on rem:cnlaw's own band, even N in
      (2e6, 4e6], the excess kurtosis reproduces its POINT
      cnlaw_kurt to three decimals.  Two independent runs of the same
      quantity, one of them at a different sieve top.
  D2  The separation is not local to that band: at every one of the
      seven octaves the real excess kurtosis lies outside the coin
      ensemble at |z| > 3.
  D3  **It is a finite-N effect**: regressing the excess kurtosis on
      log2 of the band's midpoint over the seven octaves gives a
      negative slope resolved at |t| > 2.
  D4  The control behaves: the coin's mean excess kurtosis is within
      two of its own draw-to-draw standard deviations of zero at
      every band.

REFUTATION RULE (fixed before the run)

  D1  REFUTED outside three decimals.  Then the two runs disagree
      about the same number and neither is reported until that is
      resolved.  THIS ONE GATES.
  D2  REFUTED if any band fails |z| > 3.  The small bands are where
      to expect it -- the (2^17, 2^18] band holds 65536 values of N
      against the top band's 4.19 million -- and a failure there is
      about sample size, which is why the band's count is printed
      beside every z.
  D3  **REFUTED if the slope is positive or unresolved, and that is
      the more interesting outcome.**  A flat kurtosis across seven
      octaves would say the non-Gaussianity is a property of C and
      not of the range, which is what a law would need and is
      stronger than what is predicted here.  Unresolved is the
      genuine third case: seven points is few, the octaves are
      nested in one sieve and not independent samples, and a slope
      this measurement cannot see is not a slope shown to be absent.
  D4  REFUTED if any band's coin mean is two draw-sd from zero.
      Then the coin arm has structure of its own and the z-scores of
      D2 are measured against a moving target.

  WHAT THIS CANNOT DO.  Seven octaves of a quantity that may decay
  like an inverse power of the number of terms cannot distinguish
  decay to zero from decay to a positive limit.  If D3 holds, the
  question that replaces it is the limit, and nothing here estimates
  one.
