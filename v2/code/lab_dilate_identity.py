OPEN.md, "동전을 구별하는 추정기" (the rewritten pass condition) and
"표적은 theta' > 1/2 하나" -- an exact factorisation of the demand-side
discrepancy, and what it says about the coin.

WHAT IS AT STAKE

lab_level_coin_null found that a coin on the same support gives a
SMALLER B(N;K) = sum_k (log k)|E_mu(N;k)| than mu does, at every N
tested, and the level measurement built on B had to be withdrawn.  It
was left unexplained WHY mu should be noisier than random signs in
progressions.  There is an exact reason.

Write A(N;k) for the progression sum inside E_mu,

    A(N;k) = sum_{n<N, n = N (mod k)} Lambda(n) mu(N-n).

The class n = N (mod k) is k | N-n, so with u = N-n = mk,

    A(N;k) = sum_{1<=m<N/k} Lambda(N-mk) mu(mk)
           = mu(k) * H(N;k),
    H(N;k) = sum_{m<N/k, (m,k)=1} Lambda(N-mk) mu(m),

because mu(mk) = mu(m)mu(k) when (m,k)=1 and vanishes otherwise.  So
the demand-side discrepancy at modulus k is mu(k) times a DILATED
Mobius-prime correlation at scale N/k -- the supply side's own object,
one dilation down.  A coin has no such factorisation: eps(mk) is
independent of eps(m) and eps(k), so the ratio

    r_s(N;k) = A_s(N;k) / ( s(k) * H_s(N;k) )

is identically 1 for s = mu and a random ratio for s = eps.  That is a
discriminator whose gain against the coin costs no amplification at
all -- both sides of the ratio are the same size -- which is exactly
what OPEN.md's rewritten pass condition asks for.

It also predicts the sign of the K* result: |E_mu(N;k)| is governed by
|H(N;k)|, a Mobius-prime correlation of length N/k, whereas the coin's
is a sum of N/k independent signs.  Square-root cancellation is the
best a coin can do and it achieves it; mu need not, and does not.

BACKS: Proposition {#prop:dilate} and Remark {#rem:whycoinwins} in
paper/wall_v3.md, written in the same cycle as this script.

PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS (written before this script was run)

  P1  The identity A(N;k) = mu(k) H(N;k) holds to machine precision:
      the worst relative error over every squarefree k < K coprime to N
      is below 1e-12, at every N tested.
  P2  For a coin the same ratio is not 1: the median |r_eps - 1| over k
      and 8 draws exceeds 0.5.
  P3  The fraction of k with |r - 1| < 1e-9 is exactly 1 for mu and
      below 0.01 for every coin draw.
  P4  mu is noisier than the coin in progressions, which is what
      lab_level_coin_null saw: the ratio <|A_mu(N;k)|> / <|A_eps(N;k)|>
      exceeds 1 in every k-band tested.

REFUTATION RULE (fixed before the run)

  P1  REFUTED if the worst relative error reaches 1e-12 at any N.  This
      is an identity, so any failure is an error in the derivation.
  P2  REFUTED if the median is 0.5 or below.
  P3  REFUTED if mu's fraction is below 1, or if any coin draw reaches
      0.01.
  P4  REFUTED if the ratio is 1 or below in any band.

  All four gate.
