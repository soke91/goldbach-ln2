How many layers the count needs, and what the tail costs.

WHAT IS AT STAKE

Proposition {#prop:layers} wrote the Goldbach count as
sum_m mu(m) L(N;m) with L(N;m) >= 0, and Remark {#rem:layerdecay}
found the alternating sum already within a factor 1.7 of its limit by
m of order 30.  That makes the truncation in m the operative
quantity, and it is a different truncation from the reduction's.

It is worth saying what L(N;m) is.  Lambda(N-mk) is supported where
N - mk is a prime power, so writing p = N - mk,

    L(N;m) = sum over primes p < N with p = N (mod m),
             weighted by log((N-p)/m), restricted to (N-p)/m squarefree
             and coprime to m,

up to prime powers.  So the layers are prime counts in progressions to
modulus m -- the supply side's own object -- and the m-decomposition
turns the demand into a mu-signed average of them.  Two numbers then
decide whether that is useful: how fast the tail
sum_{m>=M} mu(m) L(N;m) dies, and whether the layers follow the
1/phi(m) law a Bombieri-Vinogradov main term would give.

BACKS: Remark {#rem:layertail} in paper/theorem_A.md.

PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS (written before this script was run)

  Z1  The tail |sum_{m>=M} mu(m) L(N;m)|/N decreases over
      M = 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000, 3000 at every N.
  Z2  It is small by M = 3000: under 0.5 at every N.
  Z3  The layers follow the 1/phi(m) law up to a bounded factor. With
      R(m) := phi(m) L(N;m) log N / (N log(N/m)), every squarefree
      m <= 200 coprime to N has R(m) in [0.3, 1.5].
  Z4  The tail is small by cancellation, not by decay: holding every
      L(N;m) fixed and drawing the signs on m >= M at random, mu's
      tail at M = 3000 is below the minimum over 16 draws at every N.

REFUTATION RULE (fixed before the run)

  Z1  REFUTED by a single rise.
  Z2  REFUTED if the tail reaches 0.5 at any N -- in which case a
      bounded number of layers does not approximate the count and the
      m-truncation is no cheaper than the k-truncation.
  Z3  REFUTED if any R(m) leaves [0.3, 1.5]. A refutation says the
      layers are not governed by 1/phi(m) and the Bombieri-Vinogradov
      reading of [eq:layers] is wrong.
  Z4  REFUTED if mu's tail is at or above the minimum draw at any N,
      in which case the tail is small because the layers are small and
      no cancellation is being used.

  All four gate.

  THE CONTROL is Z4, and it is the right one for the reason Remark
  {#rem:whycoinwins} is not: the layers are held fixed and
  nonnegative, so the draw cannot buy square-root cancellation inside
  a layer. It varies only the sign pattern across m.
