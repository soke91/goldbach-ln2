The direct route's object, summed without truncation, is the Goldbach
count itself.

WHAT IS AT STAKE

lab_signed_level.py found that sum_{k<K}(log k)H(N;k) stays within a
few tenths of N over the whole accessible range while the absolute sum
reaches 13.8N, and left open whether that smallness is a cancellation
mu is doing or something an identity forces.  It is forced, and the
identity says exactly what the sum is.

A(N;k) = sum_{n<N, k | N-n} Lambda(n) mu(N-n), so summing over ALL k
with weight mu(k) log k and swapping the order,

    sum_{k>=1} (log k) mu(k) A(N;k)
      = sum_{n<N} Lambda(n) mu(N-n) sum_{k | N-n} mu(k) log k
      = -sum_{n<N} Lambda(n) mu(N-n) Lambda(N-n),

by the Mobius-von Mangoldt identity sum_{d|u} mu(d) log d = -Lambda(u).
And mu(u)Lambda(u) = -log p when u = p is prime and 0 otherwise, since
mu kills the higher prime powers.  So

    sum_{k>=1} (log k) mu(k) A(N;k) = sum_{p<N} Lambda(N-p) log p,

exactly, with no error term at all: the untruncated object IS the
Goldbach count, restricted to the prime part.  [eq:direct] is then not
an approximation waiting for an estimate but a rearrangement of
rtilde(N), and every bit of its content sits in the truncation at K.

That reframes what lab_signed_level.py saw.  The partial sums are
small not because mu cancels but because the sum has barely started:
almost all of rtilde(N) is carried by k near N, where only m = 1
survives in H(N;k) = sum_{m<N/k,(m,k)=1} Lambda(N-mk)mu(m).

PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS (written before this script was run)

  Z1  The identity is exact: sum_{k<N}(log k)mu(k)A(N;k) agrees with
      sum_{p<N} Lambda(N-p) log p to better than 1e-12 relative at
      every N. It is an identity, so anything else is an error in the
      derivation.
  Z2  That quantity is the Goldbach count: its ratio to S(N)N is
      within 0.10 of 1 at every N.
  Z3  Almost none of it is below the truncation. The partial sum over
      k < N^0.9 is under 10% of the total in absolute value, at every
      N.
  Z4  Restricting k to (k,N) = 1, as the Huang-Li setup does, does not
      change that: the coprime-restricted total is still within 0.50
      of the unrestricted one in relative terms.

REFUTATION RULE (fixed before the run)

  Z1  REFUTED at 1e-12 relative at any N.
  Z2  REFUTED if the ratio leaves [0.90, 1.10] at any N.
  Z3  REFUTED if the partial sum reaches 10% anywhere -- in which case
      the truncated range does carry a definite share and the reframing
      above is wrong.
  Z4  REFUTED if the relative difference reaches 0.50 at any N.

  All four gate.

  NO NULL IS RUN and none would mean anything. Z1 is an exact
  arithmetic identity whose reference is itself; Z2 compares against
  S(N)N, which is the reference; Z3 and Z4 are comparisons between two
  sums over the SAME terms, so any sign control would move both sides
  together. The field's sign controls were run in lab_sign_structure.py
  and lab_signed_level.py.
