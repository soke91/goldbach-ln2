error term be pushed under the signal by choosing theta'?

WHAT IS AT STAKE

Theorem {#thm:C} says

    E_3(alpha) = r~(N) - S(N)(N - C(N)) + O_A(N (log N)^{-A}),

and audit_E3_constant measured, at theta' = 0.56, that the residual

    R(N, theta') := | E_3(N; theta') - ( r~(N) - S(N)(N - C(N)) ) | / N

is about 0.26 at N = 1.6e6 while the right-hand side it is compared
against is about 0.001 -- the error swamps the signal by two orders,
so nothing accessible tests the identity's content, only its sign.
That measurement fixed theta' = 0.56.  But theta' is a free parameter
of the Corollary-1 regime, and the error terms pull against each other
in it:

  * B_log(K) = -S(N) + O(exp(-c sqrt(log K)) log K) improves as
    K = N^{theta'} grows, i.e. wants theta' large;
  * the main-term cancellation runs on sum_{m<M} f(m)/m with
    M = N^{1-theta'}, and is O(exp(-c sqrt(log M))), i.e. wants
    theta' small;
  * Bombieri-Vinogradov needs the level N^{1-theta'} below N^{1/2},
    i.e. theta' > 1/2 at all.

So there should be an interior optimum, and the question is whether it
buys enough to make the identity testable.  Nothing in either paper
sweeps theta'.

PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS (written before this script was run)

  I1  R(N, theta') has an interior minimum in theta' in (0.5, 1) at
      every N tested -- it is not monotone in theta'.
  I2  The minimising theta' is at least 0.70 at every N tested.
  I3  At the minimising theta', R < 0.10 at every N tested.
  I4  At theta' = 0.56, R reproduces the earlier audit: 0.456, 0.373,
      0.311 at N = 2e5, 4e5, 8e5.
  I5  At the minimising theta', R decreases with N across the three N.

REFUTATION RULE (fixed before the run)

  I1  REFUTED if R is monotone in theta' at any N, i.e. if the argmin
      sits at an endpoint of the swept range.
  I2  REFUTED if the minimising theta' is below 0.70 at any N.
  I3  REFUTED if R at the minimum is at least 0.10 at any N.
  I4  REFUTED if any of the three differs from the published value by
      more than 0.01.
  I5  REFUTED if R at the minimum fails to decrease between consecutive
      N.

  All five gate.  I4 is the tie to the existing audit and must hold for
  the rest to mean anything; I1-I3 are the question; I5 is what decides
  whether the accessible-range limitation is a fact about theta' or a
  fact about N.
