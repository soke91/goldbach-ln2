What separates the proved theorem from the open one, at the level of
the dilated walls.

WHAT IS AT STAKE

Proposition {#prop:dilate} gives E_mu(N;k) = mu(k)H(N;k) - C(N)/phi(k),
and Proposition {#prop:posweights} used it on the log k branch.  Used
on the OTHER branch it does the same thing to Theorem {#thm:A}:

    T_1(N) = sum_{k<K,(k,N)=1} mu(k) E_mu(N;k)
           = sum_{k<K,(k,N)=1} H(N;k) - C(N) B(K),
    B(K)   = sum_{k<K,(k,N)=1} mu(k)/phi(k) << exp(-c sqrt(log K)).

So Theorem [thm:A], which is proved unconditionally, says exactly that
the FLAT sum of dilated walls is small, while E_3 -- which is the wall
itself, by Theorem {#thm:C} -- is the same sum weighted by log k.
Both weights are nonnegative.  The whole distance between what is
proved and what is open is the factor log k inside a positively
weighted sum of the same terms.

That is worth measuring rather than asserting: how much smaller is the
flat sum, and how does the smallness degrade as the weight is turned
on through (log k)^j?

PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS (written before this script was run)

  Z1  The identity T_1(N) = sum H - C(N)B(K) holds to better than
      1e-12 relative at every N.
  Z2  The flat sum is far smaller than the log-weighted one:
      |sum H| / |sum (log k) H| < 0.2 at every N.
  Z3  |sum H|/N decays faster than |E_3|/N: fitting both against
      log N, the flat sum's exponent is the steeper.
  Z4  Turning the weight on is monotone: |sum (log k)^j H|/N increases
      with j over j = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 at every N.

REFUTATION RULE (fixed before the run)

  Z1  REFUTED if the relative error reaches 1e-12 at any N.  It is an
      identity, so a failure is an error in the derivation.
  Z2  REFUTED if the ratio reaches 0.2 at any N.
  Z3  REFUTED if the flat sum's fitted exponent is not steeper.
  Z4  REFUTED if the sequence in j is not increasing at any N.

  All four gate.
