What Proposition {#prop:dilate} does to E_3: the weights turn
nonnegative, and cross-k cancellation is not available.

WHAT IS AT STAKE

E_3(alpha) = sum_{k<K,(k,N)=1} mu(k) (log k) E_mu(N;k), and
Proposition [prop:dilate] gives E_mu(N;k) = mu(k)H(N;k) - C(N)/phi(k).
Substituting, mu(k) mu(k) = mu^2(k) = 1 on the squarefree k, so

    E_3(alpha) = sum_{k<K,(k,N)=1} mu^2(k) (log k) H(N;k)
                 - C(N) B_log(K),

    B_log(K) = sum_{k<K,(k,N)=1} mu(k) log k / phi(k)  ->  -S(N).

The signs mu(k) that Huang-Li discard by the triangle inequality, and
that this program has repeatedly said are what its results exploit,
CANCEL EXACTLY against the mu(k) inside the progression sum.  What is
left is a sum of dilated walls with WEIGHTS THAT ARE NONNEGATIVE.

The consequence is sharp.  Whatever smallness E_3 has cannot come from
the weights: it must come from the signs of H(N;k) themselves, across
k.  If those signs behaved like a coin, the sum of K terms would gain
a factor sqrt(K) over the sum of absolute values.  Measured earlier,
|E_3|/B(N) ran 0.35 to 0.54, i.e. a gain near 2 where sqrt(K) is 45 --
so the H(N;k) do not cancel across k, and each |H(N;k)| has to be
small on its own.  That is a much narrower target than "B(N) small",
and it closes off the hope that signed cancellation across dilations
could rescue the one-sided route.

For a coin there is no such collapse: eps(k) eps(mk) does not simplify,
the weights stay signed, and cross-k cancellation IS available.  So
this is also a structural discriminator, not a size one.

PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS (written before this script was run)

  T1  The identity E_3 = sum mu^2(k)(log k)H(N;k) - C(N)B_log(K) holds
      to better than 1e-12 relative, at every N tested.
  T2  The cross-k gain G_mu = sum(log k)|H| / |sum(log k)H| lies in
      [1.5, 5] at every N -- O(1), not sqrt(K).
  T3  For a coin the gain is far larger: G_eps > 5 G_mu at every N.
  T4  The absolute sum is dominated by the largest dilates: the top
      decile of k by |H| carries more than 40% of sum(log k)|H|.

REFUTATION RULE (fixed before the run)

  T1  REFUTED if the relative error reaches 1e-12 at any N.  This is an
      identity; a failure is an error in the derivation.
  T2  REFUTED if G_mu leaves [1.5, 5] at any N.
  T3  REFUTED if G_eps <= 5 G_mu at any N.
  T4  REFUTED if the top-decile share is 40% or below at any N.

  All four gate.
